Homework for lesson #9

1. **Task #1**  

Interface **"ISquare"** contains getPerimeter() and getSquare() methods.  

Abstract class **"BaseFigure"** has been created to describe an entity of abstract figure.   
Class contains 2 fields and implements 2 methods from **"ISquare"** interface.    
**"BaseFigure"** class is sealed and permits **"Circle"**, **"Rectangle"** and **"Triangle"** classes.   

Classes **"Circle"**, **"Rectangle"** and **"Triangle"** have been created to describe an entity of each figure.   
Constructor of each class contains simple assertions if figure exists or not.   
All classes above are final and extends "BaseFigure" class.    

Class **"Runner"** contains:
- logic to create some figures;
- getFigureInfo(BaseFigure[] baseFigures) method which provide perimeter and square of figure;
- getSumOfAllPerimeters(BaseFigure[] baseFigures) method which provide sum of all perimeters of figures;

2. **Task #2**

Class "Matrix" contains two static methods which return matrix.  

Class "Utils" contains static printMatrix(int[][] matrix) and multiplyMatrix(int[][] matrix1, int[][] matrix2) methods.

Class **"Runner"** contains static void main(String[] args) method which print 2 static matrices and call   
multiplyMatrix(Matrix.getMatrix1(), Matrix.getMatrix2()) method and then print multiplied matrix;

2. **Task #3**

There is an application which allow clients to do transfer from one hs card to another one. 

Each client can have some cards: "BelCard", "MasterCard" and "Visa".   
In this application static client is generated by factories: "ClientFactory" and "CardFactory".

There are some helpers:
- "CardHelper" contains next methods: getAllClientCardIds(Client client),  
getAllClientCardIdsAfterChoosingCardForTransferFrom(Client client, int cartIdForDeleting) and  
getClientCardById(Client client, int cardId).  
- "FeeHelper" contains next method: getFee(String currencyTo).    
- "TransferHelper" contains next methods: transfer(BaseCard cardFrom, BaseCard cardTo, double amount) and  
getInfoAfterTransfer(Client client, int cardIdFrom, int cardIdTo).  

There are some constans: 
- "Conversion" contains conversion rate for each currency.  
- "TransferInfo" contains info about card balance before and after transfer for card from and card to.   

Next assertions during the transfer are included:
- isCardExist(Client client, int cardId)
- isCardExistAfterChoosingCardForTransferFrom(Client client, int cardIdFrom, int cardIdTo)
- doTransferVerification(BaseCard baseCard, double sum) which include next 2 assertions:   
isTransferAmountWithinLimit(BaseCard baseCard, double sum) and   
isTransferAmountWithinBalance(BaseCard baseCard, double sum).

Class **"Runner"** implements logic to generate client, transfer money from one card to another one and then provide  
info about transfer after it.
